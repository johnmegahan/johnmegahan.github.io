<p>I am Johnny, a former Yinzer, Delawarean, San Franciscan, and a current
Tokyoite. I happily live on the edge of Shibuya with my wife and our dog, where
we enjoy walking around our little neighborhood&#8230;&#8203; except in the summer, when
it is too hot to do much of anything outside and we all become inside cats.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I love to make things. And I love to learn. I especially love to learn how to
make things, and how other people make or have made things. This has lead me
down a number of interesting paths, most recently to Japan. That eventually
lead me to Coursebase, where I work on building learning systems. Previously, I
made other things at Uber, Apple, and Beats Music, which eventually became
Apple Music.</p>
