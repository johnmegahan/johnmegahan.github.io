<p>
I'm a former Yinzer, Delawarean, San Franciscan, and a current Tokyoite, happily
living on the edge of Shibuya with my wife and our pup.
</p>

<p>
I've been programming since I was 8, writing small trivia games in lisp and basic.
But I've spent the past 10 years working in small startups and international companies
with anywhere from 3 to 3k engineers.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy focusing on high-impact changes and I love rethinking systems. The great thing
is that means I'm never bored. I can be doing anything from domain planning, architecting
distributed systems, writing a low-level effect system, pairing with other engineers,
digging into database or runtime internals, or simply fixing a ui bug that has been
annoying a user for months.
</p>

<p>
I'm interested in funtional programming, domain driven design, event sourcing,
type systems, and how we can combine all of those things to create a great system.
</p>

<p>
I usually spend my free time reading, travelling, or painting watercolor.

I am currently working at Coursebase, where I enjoy working all the way up and
down the stack building educational software.

Previous to that I was an engineer at:

<li>Beats Music, where I worked on the system and architecture for the browser-based web player</li>
