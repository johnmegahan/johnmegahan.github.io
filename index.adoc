= Hello there,
:hide-uri-scheme:

I am Johnny, a former Yinzer, Delawarean, San Franciscan, and a current
Tokyoite. I happily live on the edge of Shibuya with my wife and our dog, where
we enjoy walking around our little neighborhood... except in the summer, when
it is too hot to do much of anything outside and we all become inside cats.

I love to make things. And I love to learn. I especially love to learn how to
make things, and how other people make or have made things. This has lead me
down a number of interesting paths, most recently to Japan. That eventually
lead me to Coursebase, where I work on building learning systems. Previously, I
made other things at Uber, Apple, and Beats Music, which eventually became
Apple Music.

I have stopped using social media, so I thought I might write here more.
